<h1>Time Dilation</h1>
<p>When an object gets close enough to a black hole, it experiences time dilation. Time dilation happens near a black hole where time slows down for something falling into a black hole. The time will seem normal to the thing (or person) falling in but to an outside observer it would look like whateverâ€™s
 falling in is slowing down and getting red shifted.</p>
